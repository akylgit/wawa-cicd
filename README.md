SMALL PROJECT
1 #Manual Launch and Deployment

  Create an AWS EC2 server by hand.

  Connect to it using SSH and install Apache web server manually.

  Upload a basic index.html webpage.

2 #Automation with Terraform and Ansible

  Use Terraform to automatically create the AWS server and network settings.

  Use Ansible to set up the server, install Apache, and deploy the webpage automatically.

  Use an inventory file to tell Ansible about the servers and their keys.

3 #CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform and Jenkins

  Use Terraform locally to manage your infrastructure setup.

  Use Jenkins (on a separate machine) to automate deployments.

  Jenkins pulls your code from GitHub and runs Ansible to update the website.

  This creates an automatic workflow for building and deploying your web page.
